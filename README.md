# Blockchain-Analytics

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of articles and SQL queries designed for blockchain data analysis. The queries help extract insights about network activity, user behavior, and transaction patterns across various blockchain networks.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a toolkit for blockchain analysts, researchers, and developers who need to:
- Monitor blockchain network growth and adoption
- Analyze user behavior and retention
- Track transaction patterns and anomalies
- Generate reports and visualizations for blockchain metrics

## Query Categories

### User Metrics
Queries focused on user/address behavior analysis, including:
- New address identification and growth rates
- User retention and engagement analysis
- Address activity patterns and lifecycle analysis

### Transaction Metrics
Queries for analyzing transaction data, including:
- Volume and frequency analysis
- Fee/gas trends
- Transaction type distribution

### DeFi Metrics
*(Coming soon)* Queries for decentralized finance analysis:
- Liquidity pool metrics
- Swap activity
- Lending/borrowing behavior

### Network Metrics
*(Coming soon)* Queries for blockchain network health:
- Block production statistics
- Network congestion metrics
- Validator/miner performance

## Usage
Each query folder contains:
- SQL query files (.sql)
- Any additional notes on performance considerations or dependencies

## Data Sources
These queries are primarily designed to work with:
- Blockchain data
- Other EVM-compatible blockchain data
- Adapted versions can work with other blockchain datasets with similar structure

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request with:
- New queries for additional metrics
- Optimizations to existing queries
- Documentation improvements
